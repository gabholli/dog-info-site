# Dog Information Website

This website shows information about many dog breeds.

I created it using the following:

- React.js
- React Router 6
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js

I also used render.com to host the back end code(since it isn't possible to add a backend on Netlify).

Go to https://dog-info-site.netlify.app/ to access the site!
